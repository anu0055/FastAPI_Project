# 🚀 FastAPI Project – Scalable RESTful API Backend

Welcome to my FastAPI project! This is a modular and scalable backend built using **FastAPI**, aimed at learning and implementing real-world REST API design with modern Python tools.

---

## 🧠 What is this project about?

This project is a personal learning initiative where I’m building a fully functional REST API using FastAPI. It focuses on:
- Clean architecture & modular code
- Asynchronous programming
- Database integration with PostgreSQL
- Testing with Postman
- Admin access via pgAdmin
- Future plans for authentication, Dockerization & CI/CD

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Fully asynchronous FastAPI endpoints
- ✅ CRUD operations with SQLAlchemy ORM
- ✅ Request & response schema validation using Pydantic
- ✅ PostgreSQL database integration
- ✅ Environment-based configuration
- ✅ Modular folder structure
- 🚧 JWT Authentication (Coming Soon)
- 🚧 Docker & Containerization (Coming Soon)
